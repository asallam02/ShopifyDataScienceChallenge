# ShopifyDataScienceChallenge
submission for the data science challenge for shopify by Ammar Sallam

# Q1
Since the AOV does not account for the amount of items purchased in each order
I created a new metric called AIV (Average Item Value) as well as calculating 
the amount of items bought from each shop. This was done through Rstudio and 
all of the work can be found [here](https://github.com/asallam02/ShopifyDataScienceChallenge/blob/master/Q1.Rmd) 
as an Rmarkdown file and [here](https://github.com/asallam02/ShopifyDataScienceChallenge/blob/master/Q1.html) as an HTML file

# Q2
The answers to all of the SQL questions along with the SQL queries can be found in [this PDF](https://github.com/asallam02/ShopifyDataScienceChallenge/blob/master/Q2.pdf)
